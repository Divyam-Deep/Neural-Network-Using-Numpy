# Neural-Network-Using-Numpy
Predict: Use the current weights and bias to compute the model’s output.
Error: Calculate the difference between the model’s predictions and the actual target values.
Loss: Compute the loss using the sum of squared errors (L2 norm).
Update: Adjust the weights and bias using gradient descent to minimize the loss.
Repeat: Repeat this process for a specified number of iterations to improve the model.
